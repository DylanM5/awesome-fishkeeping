## Chemistry
*Basic chemistry required to understand the processes of the aquarium*

* [Nitrogen cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsCMYyQ0NWU) - The process in which organic matter (e.g. food, poop, dead plants) is broken down, largely by bacteria in the filter. This is why you never rinse filter media in chlorinated water. You can use a water conditioner like Seachem Prime to dechlorinate tap water.
* [pH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckbsHM2igT0) - I advise against raising or lowering the pH of your water. Perform water changes regularly to prevent a crash in pH.
